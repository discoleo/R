There has been a rise of various vegetation fires over the last decades. I will try to summarise some insights on this topic.


## A. Forest Fires

Are in general difficult to extinguish.

### Documentation
TV crews flying in helicopters for a longer time (1 hour or longer) over the affected area have provided some important / unusual insights on the effectiveness of fire crews.

### Fire Fighter Actions

#### 1. Helicopters dropping water:
Have rather limited effectiveness: this was rather surprising.

Various recorded materials show that the water drop slows down the fire for a rather short time period (minutes at most), after which the fire ignites again.

Once the wood of a tree burns then it becomes a lot harder to extinguish the fire.

Burning trees, especially when the trees are in larger amounts and when they were exposed to very dry conditions, seem very difficult to extinguish by water drops. Under such dry conditions, there is almost no water in the soil and consequently very little water in the trabeculae of the tree. Any remaining water has probably evaporated, once the tree burns. Dropping water from the **outside** won't enable the water to enter the wood.

Furthermore, if the forest is on a sloped hill or mountain, then most of the dropped water is not retained by the soil either. It either evaporates or flows down the hill. This makes burning forests very difficult to extinguish.


## Scientific Approach

Gathering more data on the fire micro-environment should enable a more detailed analysis of the fire, including how the various fire-fighter actions impact the fire micro-environment.

### Temperature

Data may include the temperature before the water drop and during the water drop, measured at various spots in the fire.

Temperature sensors can be mounted on a thermo-isolated / thermo-resistant rod. The bottom of the rod contains the recording device and is buried 50 cm below the ground.

Support personnel can rapidly dig a circular hole 50 - 60 cm deep using a circular screw-type digging tool. The bottom is buried in the hole and covered with a poorly-conducting heat material. The remaining rod with the temperature sensors points upwards.

The rod can be equipped with multiple temperature sensors: 5-10 cm below ground, at ground level, 10 cm, 20 cm, 50 cm, 1 m, 1.5 m and 2 m above ground.

Temperature can be averaged over 5 s or 10 s, or the maximum temperature over that interval can be recorded.

Support personnel can plant 10 - 30 such devices in a region that will be directly hit by fire (depending on the available time and number of available devices).

The individual devices should be somehow identifiable in order to document the exact position of the recordings.

The rods should be planted orthonormal to the ground: on slanted slopes they should lie perpendicular to the slope/ground; this standardizes the measurements.


### Water

Water dropped by firefighters can be similarly collected through some funnels located at specific heights (ground level, 10 cm or 50 cm above ground). The amount of water collected can be weighted and recorded by the underground recorder (see section on Temperature sensors).

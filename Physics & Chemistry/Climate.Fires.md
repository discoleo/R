There has been a rise of various vegetation fires over the last decades. I will try to summarise some insights on this topic.


## A. Forest Fires

Are in general difficult to extinguish.

### Documentation
TV crews flying in helicopters for a longer time (1 hour or longer) over the affected area have provided some important / unusual insights on the effectiveness of fire crews.

### Fire Fighter Actions

#### 1. Helicopters dropping water:
Have rather limited effectiveness: this was rather surprising.

Various recorded materials show that the water drop slows down the fire for a rather short time period (minutes at most), after which the fire ignites again.

Once the wood of a tree burns then it becomes a lot harder to extinguish the fire.

Burning trees, especially when the trees are in larger amounts and when they were exposed to very dry conditions, seem very difficult to extinguish by water drops. Under such dry conditions, there is almost no water in the soil and consequently very little water in the trabeculae of the tree. Any remaining water has probably evaporated, once the tree burns. Dropping water from the **outside** won't enable the water to enter the wood.

Furthermore, if the forest is on a sloped hill or mountain, then most of the dropped water is not retained by the soil either. It either evaporates or flows down the hill. This makes burning forests very difficult to extinguish.


### Scientific Approach

More data is needed on the fire micro-environment, including how such fire-fighter actions impact the fire micro-environment.

Data may include the temperature before the water drop and during the water drop, measured at various spots in the fire. ...

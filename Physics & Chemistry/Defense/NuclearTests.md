If nuclear tests are performed anyway, then scientists should be able to retrieve as much useful data as possible.

## Useful Data

Sensors and technologies have evolved massively over the years. It may be possible to gather much more detailed data nowadays than decades ago.

1. Pressure and Temperature at various distances from the core

2. Geophysical properties of rocks
  - if the new tunnel is dug close to a previous nuclear explosion, then large scale sampling of rocks may give more advanced information about the various processes after the nuclear blast;
  - Is the blast site useful as a gas storage chamber?

3. Imaging the nuclear blast
  - may be challenging due to the proximity of the camera to the actual blast (when the blast is conducted in a tunnel);

4. Magnetic impulse
  - various studies on strong magnetic impulses; but may be incompatible with points 1-3.

If nuclear tests are performed anyway, then scientists should be able to retrieve as much useful data as possible.

## Useful Data

Sensors and technologies have evolved massively over the years. It may be possible to gather much more detailed data nowadays than decades ago.

1. Pressure and Temperature at various distances from the core

2. Geophysical properties of rocks
  - if the new tunnel is dug close to a previous nuclear explosion, then large scale sampling of rocks may give more advanced information about the various processes after the nuclear blast;
  - Is the blast site useful as a gas storage chamber?

3. Imaging the nuclear blast
  - may be challenging due to the proximity of the camera to the actual blast (when the blast is conducted in a tunnel);
  - possibly useful technologies: microscope/telescope and optic fibers (fiber-optic endoscopy) can transmit the light to a high speed camera further away (e.g. in a 2nd chamber away from the bomb);
  - vacuum can be created inside the telescope tube, so that hot air does not interfere with the quality of the transmitted image;
  - the tube itself can be wrapped in terracotta so that it does not heat up (implosion) & melt to quickly;
  - a macro-lens may be necessary to be able to focus the rapidly expanding blast;

4. Magnetic impulse
  - various studies on strong magnetic impulses; but may be incompatible with points 1-3.

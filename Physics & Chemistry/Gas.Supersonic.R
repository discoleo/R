### Supersonic Gases

### Ideas
# - develop the statistical tools for supersonic hot gases;
# - model the statistics of supersonic hot gases;
# - model the shockwaves in supersonic hot gases;

### Examples:
# - sun as a hot supersonic gas;
# - nuclear blast as a supersonic gas;

#################
### Use Cases ###

### Extreme-Fission Reactors
# - reactors based on extensive fission of nuclear fuels;
# - supersonic gases will play a critical role in such reactors;
#  -- unlike plasms that are externally heated, the extreme fission
#     itself generates the actual heat, producing a supersonic gas;
#  -- containment and heat transfer may be therefore far more challenging;
# - Note:
#   I claim that the sun also functions by the principle of
#   extreme fission and *NOT* by fusion. Understanding the sun as
#   a suoersonic hot gas may be important to develop
#   specific mathematical tools.

# PolynomOS: a Revolution in Mathematics

## Math Tools & Problems

1.) Polynomials
- Multivariable polynomials in R;
- Generalization of Cardano's formula & exact solutions for higher order polynomials;
- Polynomial systems;

2.) Exact Integrals
- Polynomial Fractions;

3.) Double Integrals
- e.g. with result = Gamma(1/n)^2
- relations of the Gamma function: G(1/2n) = f(G(1/n))

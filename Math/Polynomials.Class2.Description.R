### Class 2 Polynomials
### Description
###
### draft v.0.1a


### Class 2 Polynomials:

### Roots of P[n]:
# Unlike Class 1 polynomials:
# - do NOT contain radicals of order n;
# - do not contain roots of unity of order n;
# - many can be formed using roots of unity of order [n+1];
#   [see also Generalization]


### Generalization:
# For Class 2 polynomials of Order [2*n]:
# - roots of unity of order [2*n+1] satisfy:
#   m + 1/m = r[n],
#   where r[n] is the root of a polynomial of order n;
#   [the use of roots of unity is still very practical]
# - more generally, Class 2 polynomials are
#   entanglements of lower order polynomials;
# - for P[2*n]: P[2] o P[n];
# - for P[2*n+1]: P[1]*P[2*n];
#  -- e.g. P[5] = P[1]*P[2]*P[2];

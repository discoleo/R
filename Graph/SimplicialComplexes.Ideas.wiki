'''Gedanken-experiment'''

; Idea: a new method to compute and analyse simplicial complexes;

== Terminology ==

'''Data:''' a 2D or 3D set of data points;
'''Operation:''' draw circles (balls) centered on each of the points and tangent to all its neighbours;
'''Optimization:''' minimise or maximise the area of the disks (or the volume of the balls);
'''Neighbours:''' all points that are reachable through tangent circles; any 2 circles are not allowed to intersect in 2 points;


=== Results ===

Both the configuration with the minimal area (volume) and with the maximal area (volume) should be computed. Analysing these 2 cases may reveal important details about the "simplicial" complex and about the set of data points.


== Discussion ==

=== Connected Components ===

; Connectivity: measures connectivity between points.
Parameters are needed to measure how strong the connection between different points is.

Note: It nay not be possible to connect all points. This is a useful information per se.


; "Connection Builder": transformation which enables the connection of the unconnected components.

'''Minimal Connection Builder:''' the minimum number of points that need to be removed in order to be able to connect all components;

'''Barycenter Connection Builder:''' the minimum number of points that need to be collapsed and replaced with their barycenter in order to be able to connect all components. The barycenters can be computed using weights based on the area/volumes of the corresponding disks/balls.

Barycenter Alternatives: minimise the area (or volume) of the collapsed components.

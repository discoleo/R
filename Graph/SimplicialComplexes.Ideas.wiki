'''Gedankenexperiment'''

; Idea: a new method to compute and analyse simplicial complexes;

== Terminology ==

; Data: a 2D or 3D set of data points;
; Operation: draw circles (balls) centered on each of the points and tangent to all its neighbours;
; Optimization: minimise or maximise the area of the disks (or the volume of the balls);
; Neighbours: all points that are reachable through tangent circles; any 2 circles are not allowed to intersect in 2 points;


=== Results ===

Both the configuration with the minimal area (volume) and with the maximal area should be computed. Analysing these 2 cases may reveal important details about the "simplicial" complex and about the set of data points.


== Discussion ==

=== Connected Components ===

; Connectivity: possible parameters to measure how strong the connection between different points is;
It nay not be possible to connect all points. This is a useful information per se.

; "Minimal Connection Builder": the minimum number of points that need to be removed in order to be able to connect all components;

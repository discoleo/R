'''Gedanken-experiment'''

; Idea: a new method to compute and analyse simplicial complexes;

== Terminology ==

'''Data:''' a 2D or 3D set of data points;

'''Operation:''' draw circles (balls) centered on each of the points and tangent to all its neighbours; the circles must grow to their maximal possible size, but without intersecting twice any of the other circles.

'''Optimization:''' minimise or maximise the area of the disks (or the volume of the balls);

'''Neighbours:''' all direct points that are reachable through the tangent circles; any 2 circles are not allowed to intersect in 2 points: they can be at most tangent.

'''Connected components:''' all points that are reachable through a continous path of circles/balls.


== Results ==

Both the configuration with the minimal area (volume) and with the maximal area (volume) should be computed. Analysing these 2 cases may reveal important details about the "simplicial" complex and about the set of data points.


== Discussion ==

=== Connected Components ===

; Connectivity: measures connectivity between points.
Parameters are needed to measure how strong the connection between different points is.

Note: It may not be possible to connect all points. This is a useful information per se.


; "Connection Builder": transformation which enables the connection of the unconnected components.

'''Minimal Connection Builder:''' the minimum number of points that need to be removed in order to be able to connect all components;

'''Barycenter Connection Builder:''' the minimum number of points that need to be collapsed and replaced with their barycenter in order to be able to connect all components. The barycenters can be computed using weights based on the area/volumes of the corresponding disks/balls.

Barycenter Alternatives: minimise the area (or volume) of the collapsed components.

## Users

The following audience should get familiar with Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Logic:
1. Users working with activation functions (e.g. Tanh, RELU): should gain at least basic knowledge of fuzzy logic.
2. Explainable AI: should gain *deep* knowledge of fuzzy logic and the methods used in fuzzy logic.

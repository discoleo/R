## Introduction

- shapes of leaves;
- branching patterns in trees and other plants;
- shapes of animals;
- shapes of all inner organs;
- morphology of tissues;
- morphology of tumours;

All are attractors of complex systems of differential equations. It may be possible to describe some of these cases using systems of ODEs.

## Attractors

Some of these attractors can be approximated using a Generalized Gielis Equation:

## Pleomorphic Tumours

TODO:
- stochastic ODEs;
- other techniques to simulate distributions in a system of ODEs: e.g. I1 -> I2 -> ... -> In in a compartmental model;

## Fetus Size

Most large mammals are quadrupedal. The females of such mammals can easily carry a large fetus.

However, humans are bipedal. There are major constraints regarding the mass and volume that a human fetus can have.

Therefore, human fetuses can have only a limited size and require a long period of postnatal growth and development.


### Implications

Newborn offspring will require a long period of growth and development in humans. The regulation of gene expression likely requires added complexity due to this long phase of extra-uterine growth and development. The post-natal growth in other mammals (including elephants) is probably more homogenous and requires simpler gene-regulatory mechanisms.

### Genetic Drift

Genetic drift and genetic polymorphisms in the human population can have major negative impact during this developmental phase: all inner organs experience complex growth patterns, which requires probably very tight regulation of gene expression across cells from multiple tissues.


## Cardiovascular System: Challenges

Humans are bipedal animals: the erect body posture generates enormous challenges for the cardiovascular system.

In a **quadrupedal animal**:
- the thorax and abdomen are (approximately) at the same level as the heart;
- 4 legs carry the weight: the legs can be therefore relatively smaller (less bulky) compared to human legs;
- the gluteal muscles are actually at the level of the heart;
- the head is (in  most animals) only slightly above the level of the heart;

The **giraffe** is a notable exception to this last point. However, the head is relatively small and the blood distribution across the remaining body is largely confined to the main body. The gluteal muscles are at the level of the heart as well.

The biology of the human body is very different. The erect position induces a hydrostatic pressure across the blood column. The relatively large head is obviously above the level of the heart. The 2 lower extremities must carry the entire weight and are therefore bulkier than extremities in quadrupedal animals. In addition, the gluteal muscles are well below the level of the heart and the quadriceps femoris and the tibial muscles are also well represented in humans.

All these details create formidable challenges for the cardiovascular system.

## Fetus Size

Most large mammals are quadrupedal. The females of such mammals can easily carry a large fetus.

However, humans are bipedal. There are major constraints regarding the mass and volume that a human fetus can have.

Therefore, human fetuses can have only a limited size and require a long period of postnatal growth and development.


## Implications

Newborn offspring will require a long period of growth and development in humans. The regulation of gene expression likely requires added complexity due to this long phase of extra-uterine growth and development. The post-natal growth in other mammals (including elephants) is probably more homogenous and requires simpler gene-regulatory mechanisms.

### Genetic Drift

Genetic drift and genetic polymorphisms in the human population can have major negative impact during this developmental phase: all inner organs experience complex growth patterns, which requires probably very tight regulation of gene expression across cells from multiple tissues.

## Introduction

Many microorganisms synthesise toxins. Discovery of new interesting toxins may be facilitated by competition between 2 such microorganisms.

1. Species 1: may be an eukaryotic organism, like a fungus.

2. Species 2: may be a bacterium, or some other microorganism, like algae or dinoflagellates.

The co-culturing of the 2 organisms may induce expression of interesting toxins. The presence of a eukaryotic cell (i.e. a fungus) may yield interesting toxins active on animals.

Dinoflagellates synthesise a plethora of interesting toxins, e.g. brevetoxin (produced by the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis) and many more.

Some algae may require light for photosynthesis. In this instance it is possible to select fungi which generate chromogenic pigments as the competing organism, e.g. Aspergillus niger. Other interesting fungi with tropism for certain tissues (e.g. Emmonsia parva (formerly Chrysosporium parvum)) may yield bioactive compounds with biological activity on certain organs.

## Telomeres

Loss of telomeres may be actually linked to the accumulation of somatic mutations in the Origin of Replication (Ori) regions of the lagging strand.

As the lagging-strand polymerases move only forward, there is no way to replicate the segment, once the "precedent" Ori has been damaged.

Other segments can still be replicated by the polymerase replicating a previous segment of lagging strand. But there is NO such polymerase (or Okazaki fragment) for the last segment.

The loss of telomeres may be therefore linked to accumulating somatic mutations in the Ori-regions.

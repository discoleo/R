This material examines the transmission of electrical impulses through myelinated axons.


## The Problem

The current dogma in neurobiology indicates that transmission of the nervous impulse across myelinated axons occurs in the form of electrical impulses, which jump from one node of Ranvier to the next node.

This theory is problematic for several reasons.

P.1) Electrical depolarisation involves significant movement of ions across the membrane - even if it happens only at the nodes of Ranvier. Re-establishing electrical equilibria and ionic equilibria requires significant amounts of energy. However, white matter is almost completely devoid of arterial blood flow: both in the brain and in the white matter of the spinal column. Considering the density of myelinated axons in these structures, a substantial blood flow would have been required.

P.2) Myelin Sheath as a Capacitor
One possible electrical explanation would require that the myelin sheath (or the axon beneath it) functions as a capacitor. But this is also very problematic:
- capacitors discharge rapidly, but still require time to get charged;
- charging a capacitor requires significant amounts of energy as well;
- the lack of major blood flow through the white matter suggests this mechanism is unlikely as well;

I do not see any other electrical way how the depolarisation could jump from one node to the other.


## Alternative Mechanisms

Below are some alternative possibilities.

M.1) Myelinated axons may function as protective sheets and the impulse is transmitted mechanically as e.g. the breaks on a bicycle.

M.2) Myelinated axons may function as tubes, which transmit a mechanical signal similar to those in hydraulic devices.

M.3) Myelinated axons may transmit mechanical vibrations: the Pacinian corpuscles resemble a lot myelinated axons and are involved in sensing of mechanical stimuli (pressure/vibration).

Bacterial flagella have at their base a rotor and various proteins at the base of the axon may have similar functions. These protein complexes may therefore function as mechanical machines (rotors, pumps, etc).

However, I am not an expert in this field, nor did I do any research in this area. I will let others to decide which is the most plausible mechanism. Currently I would favour the hydrostatic mechanism; but there may be others as yet not obvious way to transmit signals across the axon.

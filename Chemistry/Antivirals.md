## History

The first nucleotide inhibitor was probably the 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazol ribonucleotide in vitamin B12. It lacks the donor/acceptor nitrogens of adenine/guanine: those positions are replaced/occupied with methyl groups, which cannot form any hydrogen bonds.

As vitamin B12 is involved in transfer of methyl groups, it was probably an early mechanism of defense against viruses and bacteriophages. The time-frame of appearance: on the order of 1 billion years.

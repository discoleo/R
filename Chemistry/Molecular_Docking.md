## Introduction

Molecular docking includes 2 important steps:
1. Generation of molecular conformers/variants for the ligand
2. Optimization of the ligand docking

R offers useful tools for both steps:
- Graph/network packages: may be particularly useful for the generation of conformers;
- Optimization packages: used in the 2nd step of docking;


## 2D Tools

Some basic ideas in 2D are explored using tools in the R/Stat folder:
- Polymers.R: variants/conformers with a particular backbone;
- Polygons.R: structure optimization for 2D polygons;

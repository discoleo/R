### Class Switch

The enzyme AID (a cytidine deaminase) is implicated in IgM class switch. This idea per-se seems biochemically very implausible. Why should cytidine deamination induce DNA recombination and a class switch?

**Note:**
- Cells have mechanisms to repair U in DNA back to C;
- How is AID targeted to the gene locus coding the mu-constant region?
- Spliceosome machinery is already available in the nucleus!

Many AID mutations which preserve specific functions of the AID enzyme still lead to a deficient IgM class switch. (see Ref. 1)

**Alternative Mechanism**

1. Class switch is initiated by a yet unknown mechanism. During the class switch, a large region of the human DNA (> 55 kb) will be removed from the chromosome.

2. The DNA excision-repair mechanism may be useful to remove this large region of DNA. In order to recruit the enzymes of the excision-repair mechanism, AID is somehow recruited to the mu-constant locus.

3. The modified DNA can then be excised using the existing excision-repair mechanisms. At the same time, the excised region can be rapidly degraded, avoiding therefore the possibility to undo this step.

This alternative mechanism is based on a more complex machinery to achieve the IgM class switch. The AID enzyme is only required to mark the mu-constant locus as damaged DNA, which will recruit other machines to excise the DNA. AID is therefore not directly responsible for the class switch, but is required to complete the class switch.

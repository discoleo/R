### Class Switch

The enzyme AID (a cytidine deaminase) is implicated in IgM class switch. This idea per-se seems biochemically very implausible. Why should cytidine deamination induce DNA recombination and a class switch?

**Note:**
- Cells have mechanisms to repair U in DNA back to C;
- How is AID enforced to target (only) the gene locus coding the mu-constant region?
- Spliceosome machinery is already available in the nucleus!

Many AID mutations which preserve specific functions of the AID enzyme still lead to a deficient IgM class switch. (see Ref. 1)

**Alternative Mechanism**

1. Class switch is initiated by a yet unknown mechanism. During the class switch, a large region of the human DNA (> 55 kb) will be removed from the chromosome.

2. The DNA excision-repair mechanism may be useful to remove this large region of DNA. In order to recruit the enzymes of the excision-repair mechanism, AID is somehow (actively) recruited to the mu-constant locus.

3. The modified DNA can then be excised using the existing excision-repair mechanisms. At the same time, the excised region can be rapidly degraded, avoiding therefore the possibility to undo this step.

This alternative mechanism is based on a more complex machinery to achieve the IgM class switch. The AID enzyme is only required to mark the mu-constant locus as damaged DNA, which will recruit other machines to excise the DNA. AID is therefore not directly responsible for the class switch, but is required to complete the class switch (possibly making the step irreversible).


## MHC-1

MHC class 1 molecules may be far less specific than initially assumed. These molecules bind relatively short polypeptides (9-10 AA) and interact with TCRs which recognise the specific epitopes.

TCR **variability** ensures specificity of the recognition. I infer therefore that MHC-1 interacts primarily with the back-bone of the short oligopeptide sequence and **not** with the side chains of those amino acids; the side chains will face the TCR and primarily interact with the surface of the TCR.

Note:
- **van der Waals** forces are very weak;
- MHC-1 epitopes are very **heterogenous** (even for the same MHC-1 allele);
- the only elements in common are the amide bonds in the back-bone;

The binding to the MHC-1 is therefore very non-specific! In addition, the binding energy may be relatively small: the back-bone consists of amide-bonds, but is otherwise not rich in other binding motifs. Highly hydrophilic peptides may dissociate easily from the MHC-1 molecule; peptides which remain bound are probably rich in hydrophobic amino acids, which prevents the dissociation. The "specificity" and "affinity" of the MHC-1 molecules may be therefore a reflection of rapid dissociation and loss of water-soluble epitopes.

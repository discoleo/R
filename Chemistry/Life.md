## Genesis of Water

Early life-forms on earth were probably responsible for the formation of water:
```
CH4 + SO2 ---> 1/n (CHOH)n + S + H2O
```

Pre-biotic & early-biotic life were likely happening in DMSO or DMSO-like solvents.

Following the rapid expansion of early biotic life-forms, large quantities of water were formed, ultimately covering the entire planet.

Some bits missing from Douglas Adams' original work are provided for completion below. If he only knew a little bit more chemistry!

**"Es werde Wasser!"**
And water was formed, albeit more than was planned. This water ultimately covered the whole planet.


### Conclusions

- life may **NOT** have originated in water;
- water was formed by the massive expansion of early biotic life-forms;
- life on other planets is not necessarily dependent on water nor would it imply that large quantities of water are present;
- globular proteins may be specific for earth;

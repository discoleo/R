
# Xe - He Antiporter
: Hard Problem for gifted Chemistry students!
: Leonard Mada

## Introduction

Xe (xenon) and He (helium) are 2 noble gases.

## Question

Design a Xe - He Antiporter. Discuss the challenges and the technical solutions.

## Hints

Perform a thorough literature search:
- What is known about the compounds of xenon?
- Does Xe bind to proteins?

### Xe
Despite xenons poor reactivity, various enzymes have been crystalized having a Xe-atom bound inside the reactive cavity of these enzymes, e.g. various serine-proteases. [Ref 1] Furthermore, Xe can bind to myoglobin and hemoglobin. [2, 3] Moderately high pressures (8-12 bars) may be necessary to induce and stabilize the binding of xenon.

- Discuss the challenges when designing a xenon-binding pocket and describe various solutions which could enhance the binding affinity.
- Discuss the benefits of various non-natural aminoacids: e.g. fluorinated phenylalanines or nitro-derivatives.
- Discuss the potential benefits of metal cofactors. Which metals could prove beneficial? Consider Pt or fluorinated Pt ions as components of the binding pocket.
- Discuss the methods employed to analyse and simulate the binding of xenon to these artificially designed proteins.

### He

- Discuss the extraordinary challenges to create a He-binding pocket.
- Discuss possible methods to polarize the helium atom.

### Antiporter

- Discuss the energy source for the antiporter.

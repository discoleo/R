=== Taxol Backbone ===

; Hydrogen Bonds
* C-9 Ketone: proximity to Arg 278 & Gln 282;
* may actually occur in vivo as the C-9 di-ol form: the 2 oxygens would be closer to Arg 278 & Gln 282;
* structural refinments may incorectly correct the diol form to the ketone form;

=== Mechanism: Alpha-Helix ===

; Aromatic groups
The 3 aromatic groups are wrapping around one of the alpha-helixes which forms the pocket for GDP. The mechanism probably involves sterically blocking the mobility of this alpha-helix.


== Rational Design of Derivatives ==

=== C-9 Ketone ===

Replacing the C-9 ketone with other polar groups may stabilize the binding of the taxol backbone to tubulin. Possible candidates:
* 9,9-di-fluoro-taxol;
* 9-nitro-taxol;
* 9-phospho-taxol;

=== Aromatic Side-Groups ===

Various hydrophobic and rigid groups may also wrap around the tubulin alpha-helix and block the mobility of this chain. Examples may include:
* long chain alkyl groups;
* monocyclic groups: e.g. cyclohexane-derivatives, cyclohexene;
* polycyclic (rigid) groups: various bi- or tri-cyclic groups, e.g. camphene, bornene;
* other aromatic derivatives, including bi-arylic compounds;

Such hydrophobic groups cannot easily leave the intra-tubulin environment, as they would be exposed to the polar environment of the cell cytoplasm. Consequently, they would rigidly fix the alpha-helix. Various side chains on these groups can enhance the binding to the alpha helix; but the primary mechanism of action would NOT depend on enhanced binding.

## Aetiology

### Catechol

Catechol-type compounds are potentially toxic (e.g. phenol-type disinfectants).

**Catecholamines: Adrenaline, Noradrenaline**

- Catechol is a highly reactive phenol;
- Polymerization produces melanin-like products; (Ref. 1)
> => potentially toxic: neurotoxic or toxic on vascular smooth muscles;

Accumulation of these neurotransmitters may have a locally toxic effect, leading to a dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system and/or lesions of the vascular wall.

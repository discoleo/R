### A. Radical Generation

The generation of radicals in the cell is a dangerous process. The cells require dNTPs primarily during DNA replication. The requirement for dNTPs is much lower in the absence of DNA replication and the enzyme is probably switched off.

However, the mechanism presented does **NOT** switch off the generation of radicals. It only decouples/interrupts the flow of radicals towards the catalytic center. The metal core could still generate large quantities of radicals and damage the cell. The full mechanism how radical generation is blocked still needs to be elucidated.


### B. DNA-Binding / Helicase

Bacteria like E. coli lack a nucleus: the circular DNA lies freely in the cell.

The dNTPs are primarily needed during DNA replication: it is practical to generate the dNTPs close to the site where they are needed: the DNA or the active DNA-replication machinery.

The large ring structure could indicate a topology similar to a DNA-helicase: the RNR tetramer could wrap around the DNA strands. When activated, it generates the dNTPs close to the DNA-strands - possibly close to the strands that are replicated. This idea needs to be further explored.


### C. Eukariotes

The DNA in eukariotes is organized in chromosomes inside a nucleus. The topology of RNR may therefore differ in eukariotes compared to the topology described in E. coli. This may have significant functional consequences, which are not fully explored in the presentation.

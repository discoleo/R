**Some new theories**

## Geology

### Tibetan Plateau

- Surface area: 2.5 million km^2;
- Altitude (average): > 2 km;

If the plateau would be stretched to a height of 1 km, than it would cover an area slightly larger than Europe. If it would be stretched to an average height of 500 m, than its area would be twice that of Europe.

A continent at least the size of Europe is buried below the Tibetan plateau. And this is apart from the Himalayan mountains.

Another continent got submerged under the Eurasian plate before the merger with the Indian plate. This could have happened in the time-frame: 100-50 million years ago.


### Effects of Tibetan plateau

The rise of this plateau may have happened during the later period of the dinosaurs and may have played a major role in the extinction of the dinosaurs.

The rise in altitude had a major impact on fauna:
- difficult terrain: more energy needed for motion;
- higher altitude: less oxygen and colder climate, which would be especially challenging for non-homeothermic animals;
  - less oxygen: would have a major impact on animals with large body sizes; the lower partial pressure of oxygen would impact the diffusion in animal tissues, especially in animals with less efficient cardiovascular systems.


## Biology

The geology cannot explain the extinctions everywhere. Various other biological factors may have played important roles as well.

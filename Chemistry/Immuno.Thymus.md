The classic descriptions of thymus function and selection of T cells, including maturation of regulatory T-cells rise numerous doubts. The actual mechanisms of tolerance and T-cell selection may be very different: I will try to take a theoretical-logical approach to this problem.

## Classic Mechanisms

See review 1. Some possibly implicated mechanisms:
- Clonal deletion vs Treg switch;
- Promiscuous Gene Expression (PGE);

## Issues

The classic models have some important logical issues:

Unlike lymph nodes, there are important differences in the organization of the thymus:

1. **NO** dedicated influx of antigens into the thymus
- APCs enter lymph nodes through the afferent lymph ducts: but there is no such mechanism in the thymus;
- Histologic sections of the thymus do not show a hypervascular organ either: antigens may not enter or accumulate inside the thymus - despite various lab reports; results of various experiments may have been misinterpreted as well;

2. **NO^^ folicular zone with extensive apoptosis
- Immature B-cells undergo extensive apoptosis in the follicular zone of lymph nodes;
- there is nothing comparable in the thymus;

3. Hassel Bodies
- uncertain significance;

## Alternative Mechanisms

An alternative mechanism going along the following ideas may be more likely:

1. The thymus is mainly involved in inducing Treg cells. It has **NO** access to exogenous antigens anyway.

2. Early Treg lymphocytes are released throughout the whole body:
- the main contact with self-antigens is made inside the end-organs, where the actual self-antigens are naturally located;
- this is where the actual antigen-niche is located and includes the whole repertoire of self-antigens in "natural conditions";

Open questions:
- What are the actual processes in the periphery?
- Do these peripheral Treg cells partly return back to the thymus?
- Or do they enter lymph nodes and undergo further maturation there?
- In which stage are the various subtypes, e.g. CD25+ Foxp3+ cells?

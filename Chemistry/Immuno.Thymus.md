The classic descriptions of thymus function and selection of T cells, including maturation of regulatory T-cells rise numerous doubts. The actual mechanisms of tolerance and T-cell selection may be very different: I will try to take a theoretical approach to this problem and apply principles of basic logic in order to devise alternative mechanisms.

## Classic Mechanisms

See review 1. Some possibly implicated mechanisms:
- Clonal deletion vs Treg switch;
- Promiscuous Gene Expression (PGE);
- Aire transcriptional factor;

## Issues

The classic models have some important logical issues:

Unlike lymph nodes, there are important differences in the organization of the thymus:

1. **NO** dedicated influx of antigens into the thymus
- APCs enter lymph nodes through the afferent lymph ducts: but there is no such mechanism in the thymus;
- Histologic sections of the thymus do not show a hypervascular organ either: antigens may not enter or accumulate inside the thymus - despite various lab reports; results of various experiments may have been misinterpreted as well;

2. **NO** follicular zone with extensive apoptosis
- Immature B-cells undergo extensive proliferation and apoptosis in the follicular zone of lymph nodes;
- there is nothing comparable in the thymus;

3. Hassel Bodies
- uncertain significance;

### Issues: Promiscuous Gene Expression

Transcribing random genes from the genome is both dangerous and unlikely to play any physiologic roles. There are no mechanisms in a eukaryotic cell to transcribe some random gene and localize the resulting protein to some impermeable compartment: such randomly-expressed proteins may dysregulate any of the intra-cellular processes (e.g. nuclear transcription, cytoskeleton, metabolic pathways, cell division), thereby severely perturbing the cellular homeostasis. The logical conclusion dictates that the mechanism of promiscuous gene expression does not play any physiologic role.

It may be purely an artifact of the cell preparation procedures or of some other techniques performed in the lab.


## Alternative Mechanisms

An alternative mechanism going along the following ideas may be more likely:

1. The thymus is mainly involved in inducing Treg cells. It has **NO** access to exogenous antigens anyway.

2. Early Treg lymphocytes are released throughout the whole body:
- the main contact with self-antigens is made inside the end-organs, where the actual self-antigens are naturally located;
- this is where the actual antigen-niche is located and includes the whole repertoire of self-antigens in "natural conditions";

Open questions:
- What are the actual processes in the periphery?
- Do these peripheral Treg cells partly return back to the thymus?
- Or do they enter lymph nodes and undergo further maturation there?
- In which stage are the various subtypes, e.g. CD25+ Foxp3+ cells?

### Detailed Mechanism

A more detailed description of possible steps:

1. Step 1: naive-variants of LTs enter the thymus;
2. Step 2: these naive variants are induced to become Treg and proliferate in the cortical zone of the thymus;
3. Step 3: induced TLs leave the thymus in order to hone and mature in end organs;

Step 3 proceeds at the interface between the cortical zone and the medullary zone, forming thus the medulla (which is a LT-depleted zone). The Hassel bodies are formed by collapsing of the thymic epitheloid cells (TECs).


### TCR

The TCR undergoes mutations/recombinations during the maturation of the LTs. These events can affect the functionality of the TCR; consequently, the function of these new TCRs needs to be checked. Furthermore, the LTs are differentiated into CD4+ and CD8+ LTs, while cells with a non-functional TCR (e.g. degraded interaction with the CD4 or CD8 co-receptors) must be eliminated.

**Mechanism:**
- LT: CD4- CD8- => double positive CD4+ CD8+ & TCR recombination;
- Selection & Filtering: => single positive CD4+ or CD8+;

**Flow Cytometry:**

I would interpret very differently the results of flow-cytometry analysis of Double-Negative lymphocytes (CD4- CD8-):
- CD25- CD44-: start to express first CD25;
- CD25+ cells: start expressing CD44, but with some lag;
- there is a lot of variability in the CD25+ population: CD44 expression is a continuum;
- CD25- CD44+: small & diffuse population of cells of unknown significance;

Trees from temperate zones can be an extraordinary tool for various genetic and epigenetic studies.


## Introduction

Trees can live for hundreds of years and accumulate genetic mutations and non-genetic modifications to the cellular DNA.

Such changes are probably linked to the growth pattern of trees in temperate zones. These trees grow annually mostly during the warmer months. Growth ceases during winter and resumes again when the weather warms up. New sprouts emerge forming new buds once the weather has sufficiently warmed up.

Trees can live for hundreds of years. As cells proliferate, they accumulate mutations. In addition, the DNA may suffer non-genetic modifications as well. Each branch of a tree may have accumulated a different set of DNA mutations and modifications.

### Effects of Climate

As an example: cells which start to proliferate too early in the spring may get subject to frost and die. Cells containing DNA mutations or modifications which delay the sprouting may be more likely to survive and sprout to form new branches.

As the tree grows, it accumulates many mutations and epigenetic DNA-modifications over hundreds of years.

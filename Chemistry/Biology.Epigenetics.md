Trees from temperate zones can be an extraordinary tool for various genetic and epigenetic studies.

These trees grow annually mostly during the warmer months. Growth ceases during winter and resumes again when the weather warms up. New sprouts emerge forming new buds.

Trees can live for hundreds of years. As cells proliferate, they accumulate mutations. In addition, the DNA may suffer non-genetic modifications as well.

As an example: cells which start to proliferate too early in the spring may get subject to frost and die. Cells containing DNA mutations or modifications which delay the sprouting may be more likely to survive and sprout to form new branches.

As the tree grows, it accumulates many mutations and epigenetic DNA-modifications over hundreds of years.

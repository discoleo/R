Trees from temperate zones can be an extraordinary tool for various genetic and epigenetic studies.


## Introduction

Trees can live for hundreds of years and accumulate genetic mutations and non-genetic modifications to the cellular DNA.

Such changes are probably linked to the growth pattern of trees in temperate zones. These trees grow annually mostly during the warmer months. Growth ceases during winter and resumes again when the weather warms up. New sprouts emerge forming new buds once the weather has sufficiently warmed up.

Trees can live for hundreds of years. As cells proliferate, they accumulate mutations. In addition, the DNA may suffer non-genetic modifications as well. Each branch of a tree may have accumulated a different set of DNA mutations and modifications.

### Effects of Climate

As an example: cells which start to proliferate too early in the spring may get subject to frost and die. Cells containing DNA mutations or modifications which delay the sprouting may be more likely to survive and sprout to form new branches.

As the tree grows, it accumulates many mutations, as well as epigenetic DNA-modifications over hundreds of years.

## Statistical Models

- Stopped Random Walks: e.g. sum of daily temperatures crossing a certain threshold;


## Spring Phenological Prediction

Alternative models:

Thawing of the ground may be the leading factor during the spring phenology. The increased availability of liquid water may induce sprouting of trees in temperate climates.

The roots of a tree span a certain volume and reach to a certain depth in the ground. When the ground freezes during winter, the mobility of water halts. The mobility may be low even in deeper layers, where the earth is still above 0 degrees Celsius. However, the tree may be unable to suck up this water, as the tree lost its leafs, which minimises the pressure difference across the water capillary channels.

Once the earth has thawed up and warmed up sufficiently, the tree roots can start absorbing water through the capillary channels. Ultimately, the tree sprouts.

Once new leafs form, the evaporation rate of water increases, which amplifies this process: the roots are able to suck increasing amounts of water.

The spring phenological phenomena may therefore correlate strongly with thawing of earth and earth temperature (at different depth). This process is obviously dependent on the air temperature, but be more specific in predicting the phenological phenomena. Furthermore, soil temperature can be measured (at different depth and distances from the trunk of the tree).

Other factors may also play a role (see the Epigenetics section above).

### Repeat

Repeat action or do action closely related to baseline action:

> re\{BaseVerb}

- 0 = NO baseline-verb; no related action;
- 1 = action directly related to baseline-verb;
- 2 = action directly related to baseline word, but NO baseline verb;
- 3 = action directly related to one baseline word; but unrelated baseline-verb;
- 4 = action NOT related to baseline-verb, even if the stem is a valid verb;

Note:
- there may be some overlap and blurring between types 1 and 4;
- TODO: may need to review some of the entries;
- some verbs are non-trivially related to the baseline-noun or baseline-verb:
> rebuta, recula, rezina: from nouns rebut, recul, rezina;\
> refugia, revigora: a fugi, vigoare;


### Examples

The re\{BaseVerb} makes sense for many verbs that also have a dez{BaseVerb} variant:

- Pirotehnistii au reamorsat din greseala dispozitivul termo-nuclear.
- A nu se recongela dupa ce a fost decongelat.

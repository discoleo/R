== Introduction ==

A nice collection of combinatorics problems. Best attacked before sleep, ... at least 3-4 hours before sleep.

Problem:
- let n be a positive integer.
- 2 sequences are created: 1 to n (1:n) and a random permutation of this sequence;
- these 2 sequences are positioned on 2 parallel line segments and the corresponding numbers are matched: each number x[i] in the first sequence is matched to the corresponding number (with the same value) in the 2nd sequence;
- the intersections of the matching lines are counted;

; Cost:
Let m = infimum(number of crossings generated by the matching mechanism);
What is the average value of m?

; Cost variant:
Let m = infimum(x[i] * number of crossings generated by the matching mechanism);
[a weighted cost inclduing the value of the number as a weight]


== Topology ==

; Variants with various topologies

=== T.1. Line Segments ===
The n numbers are positioned on 2 parallel line segments.

=== T.2. Cylinder ===
T.2a: The 2 sequences are put on the delimiting circles of a cylinder and the matching is done only on the curved surface of the cylinder.

Variants:
T.2b: the numbers are positioned on 2 concentric circles away from the extremes of the cylinder, which allows matches to also traverse the remaining curved surface;
T.2c: as in [T.2a], but the matchings can cross both on the external, as well as internal surface of the cylinder. The 2 surfaces are considered distinct.

=== T.3. Sphere ===
T.3a: the 2 sequences of numbers are positioned on 2 concentric circles running over the surface of the sphere.

T.3b: the 2 sequences are positioned on 2 orthogonal equatorial circles. The numbers [0] and [0] are matched on one of the intersections, while the remaining numbers are distributed uniformely on the length of the 2 circles.

T.3c: TODO more variants;

=== T.4. Moebius Strip ===
[one of my favourites]
The 2 sequences are concatenated and are positioned on the edge of a Moebius strip. Matches can run over both sides of the surface and are considered to cross only when they intersect on the same side of the surface.


== Multiplicity ==

M.1: only 1 copy of the 1:n sequence and 1 copy of the random permutation are used.

M.2: Multiplicity d;
There are various variants to arange the d copies of the sequences:
M.2a: d copies of the 1:n sequence are generated. The d copies are concatenated one after each other.
M.2b: d copies of the 1:n sequence are generated. Each number is repeated d times.
M.2c: d copies of the 1:n sequence are generated. This multiple sequence (with all numbers) is permuted.
